2. Check that images display correctly in README.md
3. Commit the screenshots folder to your repository

## Alternative (If Screenshots Not Available)

If you cannot take screenshots now:
- Screenshots will be automatically displayed once the files are added to this directory
- The README already has placeholders that will show images when files are present
- You can also use tools like Figma or design mockups temporarily

**Note**: The README is fully functional without screenshots, but adding them will significantly improve documentation quality and user understanding of the system.
